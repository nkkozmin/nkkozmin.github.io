##### Create and edit a NURBS surface with control points.

> This option specifies whether the surface is exact or approximated. By default, the surface is set to **Exact**.

1. In the **Control Panel**, choose from the following:
    * **Exact:** Select this option if you want to achieve precise dimensions and do not plan to modify the original shape. For example, if you have created a sphere with a radius of 5 cm, choosing **Exact** will give you a radius that is exactly 5 cm.
    * **NURBS Degree 3 or 5:**  Select one of the degree options if you want to modify the shape at a later point. Choose a higher degree for a smoother curvature. For example, if you have created a sphere with a radius of 5 cm, choosing a degree option will give you a radius that is almost, but not quite, 5 cm.<br><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> **Note:** The following options only apply to the **NURBS Degree** options.

2. Adjust the NURBS surface.

To | Do this
:--- | :---
Modify the number of points | In the **Control Panel**, type the number of **Points**.<br><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> **Note:** For the **Sphere** and **Torus** tools, **Longitude Points** and **Latitude Points** can be modified.
Reposition control points | Drag a point.<br>Click a point, and then type the **x**, **y**, and **z** coordinates.
Modify multiple points | *To select multiple points at one time, do one of the following:*<br>Click a blue line, and then drag one of the selected points.<br>Click and drag mouse over points to create a selection box, and then drag one of the selected points.
Revert changes | Select the points, and then in the **Control Panel**, select **Un-edit selected**.<br><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> **Note:** For the **Extrude** and **Revolve** tools, click **Un-edit all** to revert all changes to points.
